""" You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product
of every integer except the integer at that index.

Write a function get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes a
list of integers and returns a list of the products.

For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

your function would return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]

by calculating:

  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]

Here's the catch: You can't use division in your solution! """
